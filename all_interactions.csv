A reduction of food intake imposed on control rats (pair-feeding), aimed at mimicking leptin-induced hyperphagia, produced a marked decrease in the expression of muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), whereas ICV infusion of leptin prevented such a decrease in UCP-3

The purpose of this study was to determine  whether the relatively modest fuel-stimulated insulin secretion responses  of rodent beta-cell lines might be explained by inadequate expression or  activation of PLC isoforms.
Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLC-delta1, -beta1, or  -beta3 in INS-1 or betaG 40/110 cells results in little or no enhancement  in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and no improvement in insulin  secretion when the cells are stimulated with glucose or carbachol, despite  the fact that the overexpressed proteins are fully active in cell  extracts.
Overexpression of PLC-beta1 or -beta3 in normal rat islets  elicits a larger increase in IP accumulation but, again, has no effect on  insulin secretion.
Because the effect of carbachol on insulin secretion is  thought to be mediated through muscarinic receptors that link to the Gq/11  class of heterotrimeric G proteins, we also overexpressed G11alpha in  INS-1 cells, either alone or in concert with overexpression of PLC-beta1  or -beta3.

OBJECTIVE: In order to elucidate the roles of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and oxytocin (OT) receptors in rabbit parturition, the concentration of IP3 induced by OT and the OT receptor levels were determined in rabbit myometria before and after parturition
METHODS: The effects of OT on IP3 formation and OT receptor levels were determined in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, Days 26, 28 and 30 of pregnancy rabbits, postpartum rabbits within 12 hours and steroid-treated ovariectomized rabbits
RESULTS: OT receptors were not detectable in the myometria of non-pregnant rabbits, and OT had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (IPs)
On Day 28 of pregnancy, OT receptors became detectable, and then OT could induce the formation of IPs
Thereafter, the stimulatory effects of OT on IPs formation and the OT receptor levels dramatically increased toward the end of pregnancy and reduced rapidly after parturition
When the ovariectomized pregnant rabbits were treated with estrogen, OT receptors in the myometrium were induced, and OT acquired the ability to stimulate IP3 formation
In addition, an OT receptor antagonist inhibited the stimulatory effects of OT on IP3 formation

Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1. Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1 alpha. Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1. A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors","[('T6', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (300, 305)), ('T7', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (341, 345)), ('T4', 'pm0113245', 'Tat-binding protein-1', (209, 230)), ('T5', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (232, 237)), ('T8', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (365, 369)), ('T26', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (1017, 1021)), ('T9', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (374, 384)), ('T25', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (984, 994)), ('T24', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (945, 950)), ('T23', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (894, 904)), ('T22', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (878, 882)), ('T21', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (846, 856)), ('T20', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (803, 808)), ('T1', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (12, 16)), ('T3', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (195, 199)), ('T2', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (122, 132)), ('T10', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (411, 416)), ('T11', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (441, 451)), ('T12', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (514, 519)), ('T13', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (532, 537)), ('T14', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (623, 633)), ('T15', 'pm0104236', 'VHL', (674, 677)), ('T16', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (697, 701)), ('T17', 'pm0113245||pm0120764', 'TBP-1', (705, 710)), ('T18', 'pm0104236', 'pVHL', (713, 717)), ('T19', 'pm0100197', 'Hif1 alpha', (783, 793))]","{'R1': ('T1', 'T2'), 'R10': ('T1', 'T1'), 'R11': ('T1', 'T1'), 'R12': ('T1', 'T1'), 'R13': ('T2', 'T2'), 'R14': ('T2', 'T2'), 'R15': ('T2', 'T2'), 'R2': ('T3', 'T4'), 'R3': ('T3', 'T5'), 'R4': ('T6', 'T7'), 'R5': ('T6', 'T8'), 'R6': ('T6', 'T9'), 'R7': ('T1', 'T1'), 'R8': ('T1', 'T1'), 'R9': ('T1', 'T1')}",1

In addition, GC-GAP contains several classic proline-rich motifs, and it interacts with the first SH3 domain of Crk and full-length Nck in vitro.

HPRD50_d32,"Differential binding of vascular cell-derived proteoglycans (perlecan, biglycan, decorin, and versican) to the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have demonstrated the immunolocalization of perlecan, a specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan, to the beta-amyloid protein (A beta)-containing amyloid deposits within the walls of blood vessels (i.e., congophilic angiopathy) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Overall, the results indicate that specific vascular cell-derived PGs differentially interact with A beta, and that the interactions of highest affinity occur between A beta and binding sites on both the core protein and glycosaminoglycan chains of perlecan. In the present investigation, the differential binding of previously characterized endothelial cell (EC)- and smooth muscle cell (SMC)-derived PGs to A beta was examined to determine whether the accumulation of A beta in cerebrovascular amyloid deposits may be due to its interactions with perlecan. Pretreatment of AA amyloidotic splenic and liver tissue sections with synthetic A beta (1-28) produced strong immunoreactivity with A beta antibodies at tissue sites enriched in perlecan which was partially removed by pretreatment with heparitinase, but not by chondroitin ABC lyase. [35S]-Sulfate labeled proteoglycans (PGs) derived from cultured ECs and SMCs bound to affinity columns containing A beta (1-28) or (1-40), with virtually no binding to A beta (40-1) (reverse peptide), beta-amyloid precursor protein (410-429), or bovine serum albumin. Characterization of EC and SMC PGs bound to A beta (1-28) revealed strong binding by perlecan, weak binding by decorin and biglycan, two dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and lack of binding by versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan","[('T6', 'pm0112250', 'heparan sulfate proteoglycan', (237, 265)), ('T7', 'beta-pm0104696', 'beta-amyloid', (274, 286)), ('T4', 'pm0106611', 'versican', (94, 102)), ('T5', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (216, 224)), ('T8', 'pm0104696', 'amyloid', (315, 322)), ('T9', 'pm0108066', 'PGs', (497, 500)), ('T25', 'pm0106611', 'PG-M', (1739, 1743)), ('T24', 'pm0106611', 'versican', (1730, 1738)), ('T23', 'pm0124379', 'biglycan', (1661, 1669)), ('T22', 'pm0108608', 'decorin', (1649, 1656)), ('T21', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (1623, 1631)), ('T20', 'pm0108066', 'PGs', (1569, 1572)), ('T1', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (61, 69)), ('T3', 'pm0108608', 'decorin', (81, 88)), ('T2', 'pm0124379', 'biglycan', (71, 79)), ('T10', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (680, 688)), ('T11', 'pm0101876', 'SMC', (819, 822)), ('T12', 'pm0108066', 'PGs', (832, 835)), ('T13', 'pm0104696', 'amyloid', (926, 933)), ('T14', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (979, 987)), ('T15', 'pm0116983', 'perlecan', (1166, 1174)), ('T16', 'pm0102466', 'ABC', (1261, 1264)), ('T17', 'pm0108066', 'PGs', (1308, 1311)), ('T18', 'pm0103143', 'serum albumin', (1524, 1537)), ('T19', 'pm0101876', 'SMC', (1565, 1568))]","{'R1': ('T5', 'T7'), 'R2': ('T5', 'T8'), 'R3': ('T6', 'T7'), 'R4': ('T6', 'T8'), 'R5': ('T2', 'T2'), 'R6': ('T2', 'T2'), 'R7': ('T2', 'T2')}",1

Yet, whether Gadd45b and/or Gadd45g function as inhibitors of cdc2/cyclinB1 kinase and/or play a role in G2/M cell cycle arrest has not been fully established.

Mutational analyses of the beta-2 cytoplasmic domain revealed that the adhesive function of LFA-1 depends on its interaction with cytohesin-1, unless the integrin is activated by exogenous divalent cations. Secondly, cytohesin-1 induces expression of an extracellular activation epitope of LFA-1, and the exchange factor function is not essential for this activity. In contrast, LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 is strongly inhibited by a cytohesin-1 mutant, which fails to catalyze ARF GDP-GTP exchange in vitro.
