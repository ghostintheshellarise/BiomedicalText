Data sets I curated from Gold Standard to facilitate my work on Causal Relation Extraction between Biomedical Entities.

Source: Corpora in Stav (http://corpora.informatik.hu-berlin.de)

Data Sets:
1. BioInfer - protein-protein interactions *
2. HPRD50 - protein-protein interactions *
3. IEPA - protein-protein interactions *
4. LLL - protein-protein interactions *

You can find respective source files in .txt format here

I also provide a .csv file that consolidates above data set.
